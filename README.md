JustTerms is a vocabulary website aimed at reinforcing terms on a weekly bases; it is meant to be used as a supplement to bigger site that focus more so on grammar and other aspects of the language. 


The user is given a wordlist and is suppose to gradually study the terms given until they are ready for testing

The testing portion of the site will contain 3 different test that will determine at the end if the user is ready to move on to a new set of words

Although the test are given to benchmark the users merits for moving on, the user will have the option to create a new list whenever desired despite if any progress or studying was done on the prior list.

JustTerms is the homepage: you will be shown you current list (if any),  a button to generate a new list, words mastered, and more.

Study is the part of the site where the list definitons are covered until you hover over them (thereby allowing the user to think about what the defintion is).

Test is the final process when the user feels ready to test their knowledge of the words in the list.
